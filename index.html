<p class="Body_text"> Bronzeville, the heart of 18920 African American Chicago, is an integral part to Chicago’s African American history. Partially sitting on the site of Camp Douglas (one of the norths largest confederate prison camps), Bronzeville was flooded with African Americans fleeing and racism in the south during the great migration, where Chicago’s higher paying jobs meant that people of color had disposable income creating a thriving metropolis. This newfound populations meant that businesses were started up, creating a second business hub on the south side of Chicago. Bronzeville grew up around State Street between 31st and 39th, and Grand Boulevard, now called Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, where our tour of historic Bronzeville started. </p>

<p class="Body_text"> Our first landmark was the bronze map – located at the heart of Bronzeville, the bronze map depicts the landmarks of the history from the Chicago defender and bee to the areas rich history in jazz, blues and gospel – all icons of the achievements of Chicago’s African American. The maps central location helps guide tourists and locals alike through the history of the area, and proved inspiration for some of the locations we visited during the tour. </p>

</div>
<div id = "main_content">
<p class="Body_text"> Just across the road from the bronze map is the supreme life building. Originally called the liberty life building, the owner and founder of the insurance company, Frank L. Gillespie, renamed the company, and with it the building, to the supreme life insurance company in the early 20th century. It was the first insurance company for people of colour at a time when white company’s rarely offered insurance to them, offering people of color the same protections as white people, and he worked hard to hire and train black agents for the company. The building left in his legacy was nearly demolished in the 90’s before being bought by the black metropolis and tourism council that also owns other sites of historical importance in Chicago.</p>

  <p class="Body_text"> Facing south in front of the Supreme insurance building is the Victory Monument. Originally produced in 1927, the victory monument later had the solider on the top added in 1936, and acts as a memorial to the 8th regiment of the national guard, the first all-black regiment who are based just west on 35th street -more on that in a minute. The 8th regiment fought in World War 1 in France as the 370th Infantry of the 93rd division and were notable for being the last regiment to pursue the Germans through France in WW1. The 3 panels at the base represent the victory in WW1, the battles the regiment fought and on the front a member of the regiment with an American eagle.</p>

  <p class="Body_text"> Nearby is the regiments armory – the 8th regiments armory was used by the regiment and subsequent military regiments until the mid-1950s. The armory itself was built in 1914 at the break of war in Europe. The 8th regiment played a part in WW2 as well as the 184th artillery and is now based elsewhere as the 178th infantry of the Illinois National Guard. </p>

<div id = "main_content">
  <p class="Body_text"> Moving to 31st street, we see the statue of Paul Lawrence Dunbar, located (appropriately) in Dunbar park. Paul Dunbar is known as one of the first great African American poets, and like many in Bronzeville, fled the south to make home in Dayton, Ohio and as his career progressed (producing work such as “oak and ivy”) he befriended Fredrick Douglass, who managed to get Dunbar to speak at the Worlds Columbian Exposition. From there his career grew, and he became one of the first notable poets of color, spreading to nationwide acclaim. He now has many high schools named after him, including Dunbar Vocational High in Bronzeville.</p>

  <p class="Body_text"> Just of 31st street on Indiana sits unity hall. Sitting in what is now a quiet part of Bronzeville, Unity Hall was designed by L. B. Dixon as a Jewish social club (called the lakeside club) for young men in 1887 due to the high attendance of the original social club at 13th. The building was renamed to Unity hall in 1917 when it became the headquarters of the people’s movement club. This club, located in what was by this point the heart of the black metropolis, was headed by influential figure Oscar Stanton DePriest, who became the first African American to be elected to congress from the northern United States, and was one of the most well organized political groups of the black metropolis. The building was declared a Chicago landmark as of 1998, but in 2012 was nearly demolished due to disrepair; the building is now under renovation for student accommodation. </p>

  <p class="Body_text"> Just south on Indiana is the shell of the original Pilgrim Baptist church, held up by scaffolding. Like so many buildings in northern Bronzeville, it was originally built for the Jewish faith as a synagogue before being taken over as a Baptist church in 1922. This building plays a very significant part in American history, being the building and congregation credited with the creation of gospel music sometime in the 1930’s by Thomas A. Dorsey, the “father of gospel music”. The church also hosted the funeral of the first African American heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson, and several sermons were delivered during the civil rights movement by Martin Luther King Jr. The building burnt down in 2006 during restoration and only the walls survived. The building is currently being braced while restorations are underway to turn the building into a museum of gospel music, which will be the nations first.</p>

  <p class="Body_text"> The Chicago defender building on 35th and Indiana produced the newspaper from 1920 till 1960. The newspaper itself was founded by Robert S. Abbot in 1905 and was one of the most influential news papers in the era of the great migration and of the black metropolis. The newspaper started to take off in 1915 when African Americans started freeing oppression in the south. The paper was at first smuggled into the south by porters for the pullman company, often against the laws of the southern states there where destined for. The paper was also one of the first newspapers to omit derogatory terms for people of color from its printing and was one of the main catalysts behind the great migration. Some of papers most prominent contributors include Ida B. Wells, who herself resided in Bronzeville, and Louis Lomax. Ida B. Wells was a political activist that fought sexism, racism and violence, as well as focusing ion urban reform in Chicago itself.</p>

When the mural is complete it will feature prominent local figures including Louis Armstrong, Nat King Cole and Lorraine Hansberry.</p>
