<p class="Body_text"> Bronzeville, the heart of 18920 African American Chicago, is an integral part to Chicago’s African American history. Partially sitting on the site of Camp Douglas (one of the norths largest confederate prison camps), Bronzeville was flooded with African Americans fleeing and racism in the south during the great migration, where Chicago’s higher paying jobs meant that people of color had disposable income creating a thriving metropolis. This newfound populations meant that businesses were started up, creating a second business hub on the south side of Chicago. Bronzeville grew up around State Street between 31st and 39th, and Grand Boulevard, now called Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, where our tour of historic Bronzeville started. </p>

<p class="Body_text"> Our first landmark was the bronze map – located at the heart of Bronzeville, the bronze map depicts the landmarks of the history from the Chicago defender and bee to the areas rich history in jazz, blues and gospel – all icons of the achievements of Chicago’s African American. The maps central location helps guide tourists and locals alike through the history of the area, and proved inspiration for some of the locations we visited during the tour. </p>
