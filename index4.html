<p class="Body_text"> Our first landmark was the bronze map – located at the heart of Bronzeville, the bronze map depicts the landmarks of the history from the Chicago defender and bee to the areas rich history in jazz, blues and gospel – all icons of the achievements of Chicago’s African American. The maps central location helps guide tourists and locals alike through the history of the area, and proved inspiration for some of the locations we visited during the tour. </p>

<div id = "main_content">
<p class="Body_text"> Just across the road from the bronze map is the supreme life building. Originally called the liberty life building, the owner and founder of the insurance company, Frank L. Gillespie, renamed the company, and with it the building, to the supreme life insurance company in the early 20th century. It was the first insurance company for people of colour at a time when white company’s rarely offered insurance to them, offering people of color the same protections as white people, and he worked hard to hire and train black agents for the company. The building left in his legacy was nearly demolished in the 90’s before being bought by the black metropolis and tourism council that also owns other sites of historical importance in Chicago.</p>

<div id = "main_content">
<p class="Body_text"> Facing south in front of the Supreme insurance building is the Victory Monument. Originally produced in 1927, the victory monument later had the solider on the top added in 1936, and acts as a memorial to the 8th regiment of the national guard, the first all-black regiment who are based just west on 35th street -more on that in a minute. The 8th regiment fought in World War 1 in France as the 370th Infantry of the 93rd division and were notable for being the last regiment to pursue the Germans through France in WW1. The 3 panels at the base represent the victory in WW1, the battles the regiment fought and on the front a member of the regiment with an American eagle.</p>

<p class="Body_text"> Nearby is the regiments amour – the 8th regiments armory was used by the regiment and subsequent military regiments until the mid-1950s. The armory itself was built in 1914 at the break of war in Europe. The 8th regiment played a part in WW2 as well as the 184th artillery and is now based elsewhere as the 178th infantry of the Illinois National Guard. </p>
